Instructions
===============================

This is a simple frogger style game, created as a project for Udacity's Front End Web Dev nanodegree.

To play the game:

1. open the index.html file.

2. Use the directional keys on the keyboard to navigate.

3. Try to reach the water (for some reason).

Note:

* Reaching the water will reset you to the start.

* Striking a bug will also reset you to the start.
