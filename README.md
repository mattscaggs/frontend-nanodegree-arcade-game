Instructions
===============================

This is a simple frogger style game, created as a project for Udacity's Front End Web Dev nanodegree.

To play the game:

1. Open index.html.
2. Use the directional keys on the keyboard to navigate.
3. Avoid the bugs.
4. Try to reach the water (as many times as you want!).

Note:

* Reaching the water will reset you to the start.
* Striking a bug will also reset you to the start.
* Hitting refresh will reset you to the start.
