frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

This is a simple frogger style game, created as a project for Udacity's Front End Web Dev nanodegree. To play the game, simply open the index.html file. Use the directional keys on the keyboard to navigate. The objective is to reach the water (for some reason). Reaching the water will reset you at the start so can keep playing again, and again, and again... Striking a bug will also reset you to the start. Begs the questions as to the point, but stay tuned for added features at some point, maybe.
